## üí° Description
SlimValidator is a Java library for providing object validation through annotations. It is inspired by the Java Bean Validation specification but is not a implementation at all.

For example, to validate the object of a class, we need to annotate its fields with constraints and then use the `Validator` class to evaluate all the constraints:

```java
/* Classes definition with constraint annotations */

class Person {

  @Required
  Integer id;

  @Required
  @Size(max = 50)
  String fullName;

  @Required
  Gender gender;
  
  @Range(min = 2000)
  Double income;

  @Size(min = 3, max = 5)
  String[] hobbies;

  @Valid
  Address address;

  @ObjectType(baseClass = String.class)
  @ObjectType(baseClass = String.class, firstGroup = true, maxSize = 3)
  Object reference;

  // Constructors , getters, setters, etc.

}

class Address {

  @Required
  @Size(max = 50)
  String streetNumberName;

  @Size(max = 4)
  String apartment;

  @Required
  String city;

  // Constructors , getters, setters, etc.

}

enum Gender {
  MALE,
  FEMALE,
  OTHER
}

/* Instantiate objects of those classes */

var address = new Address();
address.setStreetNumberName("1765 Paramount Avenue");
address.setApartment("123-A");

var person = new Person();
person.setFullName("Martin Jefferson");
person.setGender(Gender.MALE);
person.setIncome(1850.5);
person.setHobbies(new String[] {"dancing", "running"});
person.setAddress(address);
person.setReference(List.of(10, 20));

/* Validate objects */

var validator = new Validator();
var violations = validator.validate(person);
violations.forEach(v -> System.out.println(v.getName() + " " + v.getMessage()));
```
As a result of the validation process, you will see the following messages in console:
```txt
id must not be null.
income must be at least 2000.
hobbies size must be at least 3 at most 5.
address.apartment size must be at most 4.
address.city must not be null.
reference type must be or String or Collection<String> (max 3 items).
```

## üö© Constraints

### @Required
- **Description**: Checks that a value is not null.
- **Applies to**: Fields of any type.
- **Parameters**:
    - _(none)_.
- **Error messages**:
    - If the value is null:
        - _must not be null._
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @Required
    private Long id;
    ```

### @Range
- **Description**: Checks that a value is within a closed range.
- **Applies to**: Fields of any numeric type.
- **Parameters**:
    - _min_: The lowest value of the range. By default is Double.MIN_VALUE.
    - _max_: The greatest value of the range. By default is Double.MAX_VALUE.
- **Error messages**:
    - If _min_ was set and the value is lower:
        - _must be at least {min}._
    - If _max_ was set and the value is greater:
        - _must be at most {max}._
    - If _min_ and _max_ were set and the value is out of range:
        - _must be at least {min} at most {max}._
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @Range(min = 0.0, max = 100.0)
    private Double grade;
    ```

### @Size
- **Description**: Checks that a text's length or a group's size is within a closed range.
- **Applies to**: Fields of type: String, Collection, Map or Object array.
- **Parameters**:
    - _min_: The lowest value of the length or size. By default is 0.
    - _max_: The greatest value of the length or size. By default is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
- **Error messages**:
    - If _min_ was set and the length or size is lower:
        - _size must be at least {min}._
    - If _max_ was set and the length or size is greater:
        - _size must be at most {max}._
    - If _min_ and _max_ were set and the length or size is out of range:
        - _size must be at least {min} at most {max}._
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @Size(min = 2, max = 5)
    private List<Project> projects;
    ```

### @ObjectType
- **Description**: Checks that the type of an object is one of a list of candidate types.
- **Applies to**: Fields of the Object type, including Collection of objects or Collection of Collection of objects. Collection can be any subinterface such as: List, Set, etc.
- **Parameters**:
    - _baseClass_: A candidate base class for the field. Mandatory.
    - _firstGroup_: A boolean to indicate if the type is a Collection of the base class. By default is false.
    - _secondGroup_: A boolean to indicate if the type is a Collection of Collection of the base class. By default is false.
    - _maxSize_: The greatest size of the first Collection if set. By default is 0.
- **Error messages for each @ObjectType**:
    - If only _baseClass_ was set and the field type does not match:
        - _{baseClass}_
    - If _firstGroup_ was set and the field is not Collection of the baseClass:
        - _Collection<{baseClass}>_
    - If _firstGroup_ and _maxSize_ were set and the field is not a Collection of the baseClass or collection size is greater than maxSize:
        - _Collection<{baseClass}> (max {maxSize} items)_
    - If _firstGroup_ and _secondGroup_ were set and the field is not a Collection of Collection of the baseClass:
        - _Collection<Collection<{baseClass}>>_
    - If _firstGroup_, _secondGroup_ and _maxSize_ were set aand the field is not a Collection of Collection of the baseClass or first collection size is greater than maxSize:
        - _Collection<Collection<{baseClass}>> (max {maxSize} items)_
- **Error message for all @ObjectType**:
    - If the field type does not match any ObjectType:
        - _type must be or {msg for ObjectType 1} or {msg for ObjectType 2} ... or {msg for ObjectType N}._
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @ObjectType(baseClass = String.class)
    @ObjectType(baseClass = String.class, firstGroup = true, maxSize = 2)
    @ObjectType(baseClass = String.class, firstGroup = true, secondGroup = true, maxSize = 2)
    Object reference;
    ```

### @Valid
- **Description**: Flag to do nested validation for fields without any constraint.
- **Applies to**: Fields of custom classes that do not have any constraint but it requires to validate their nested fields. Any constraint (Required, Range, Size, ObjectType) enable nested validation automatically.
- **Parameters**:
    - _(none)_.
- **Error messages**:
    - _(none)_.
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @Valid
    private Address mainAddress;
    ```
