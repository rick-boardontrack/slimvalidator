# Contributing
Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to the improvement of this project. Please, follow the next guidelines.

## General Guidelines
1. Keep the code compatible with Java 11.
1. Follow existing code styles present in the project.
1. Avoid adding new dependencies as much as possible.
1. Ensure to add Javadoc where necessary.
1. Provide unit tests for your code.
1. Large features should be discussed with maintainers before implementation. Use the [Discussion](https://github.com/sashirestela/slimvalidator/discussions) section for this.

## Code Formatting
This project is configured with [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven) to automatically check code formatting against a [custom code format](codestyle/spotless_java_eclipseformat.xml) specification of modern Java, as well as [import order](codestyle/spotless_java.importorder).

Spotless comes with two Maven commands that you can run at any moment, preferably before committing your changes:

- `mvn spotless:check`, to verify if code is formatted correctly.
- `mvn spotless:apply`, to rewrite the source code in place.

The remote build will check the code formatting, so the build will fail if the code isn't formatted correctly.


## Configure IDE (Optional)
You could set your favorite IDE to be aligned to the custom code format. See details below.

3. In the _Imports_ tab for the previous scheme, change the values:
    - In _General_ section, mark the option _Use single class import_
    - In the field _Class count to use import with '*'_ put the value 99

4. At the bottom part in the _Imports_ section, change the import statement order as:
    - **import** all other imports
